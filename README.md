# ULTRACRAFT
This mod is a tribute to the game ULTRAKILL (by Arsi "Hakita" Patala)

Curseforge: https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/absolute-ultracraft <br>
Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/mod/absolute-ultracraft

I recommend installing Mod Menu, so you can access the Settings.<br>
To get dynamic Lighting on skulls, projectiles and appropriate enemies, install LambDynamicLights as well. (this is optional)
